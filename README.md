# GamesWithSwingAndAWT

Implementing GUIs is a great way to learn about and appreciate OOP.

GUIs are graphical user interfaces that present your code to the user in a nice way. Usually youll offer things like
* button
* radio button
* text input
* text ouput
* check box

There are many GUI frameworks out there for every language:
* Java - Swing / AWT
* C - QT, GNOME, KDE
* Python - Kivy
* Javascript/CSS/HTML - when you make websites a big thing you do is you leverage these tools to make a nice looking layout with buttons and stuff.

## Appreciating OOP
Object oriented programing is awesome for a bunch of reasons - one is abstraction! 

When you make a GUI, most of the gory details of how the GUI is drawn on the screen, and how buttons handle the input events - 
usually all of this stuff is abstracted away for you and encapsulated into simple useful classes.

In this lecture we look at a very good, albeit slightly outdated tutorial on swing and awt.

And after just a few minutes of looking at some code examples and reading a bit we can build a nice GUI!

This is all because the developers of Swing and AWT did a great job of encapsulating functionality for us and giving us some very easy to understand classes.

## Lecture plan
We're looking at these two references:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-swing-jpanel-with-examples/?ref=lbp
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-swing-jtextarea/?ref=lbp

and then we'll try to understand buttons, jframes, jpanels and jtextarea.

Then we'll look at an ugly tic tac toe game I threw together in a few minutes and discuss how you can improve it.

Then you will improve it for homework.

Feel free to throw away my design completely if you have a better idea!
